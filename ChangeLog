nilfs-2.0.4  Wed Aug  6, 2008 JST

	* fix hangup problem while deleteing huge files:
	  Alexander Schier had reported that OOM killer was invoked while
	  deleting very large files. This turned out to be the problem of
	  a btree truncate routine, which creates a number of dirty blocks for
	  huge files without permitting to write them out.
	  A similar problem was also found in file truncation.
	    This fixes these problems by allowing NILFS2 to write out dirty
	  blocks during terminating or truncating bmap of huge files.
	  Thank you Alex for reporting this issue.
	* supported kernel 2.6.27-rc1 experimentally.
	* remove redundant code and resolve new checkpatch warnings.

nilfs-2.0.3  Mon Jul 14, 2008 JST

	* add 2.6.25 and 2.6.26 to the supported kernel versions.
	* fix a compile-time error for the kernel 2.6.26 in case of
	  CONFIG_NILFS_DEBUG=y.
	* fix build errors on ia64 machines.
	* fix hang problem after read/write remount.
	* improve writeback implementation to avoid page locks and allow read
	  accesses against page cache during writebacks.
	* eliminate the prepare dirty flag on B-tree node pages to reform
	  readability of the B-tree cache code.
	* revise README.
	* Cleanups; remove unused code or redundancy in the code,
	  resolve several type of checkpatch warnings, and so forth.

nilfs-2.0.2  Wed Mar 26, 2008 JST

	* fix mount failure of nilfs-2.0.1 for 2.0.0 filesystem.
	  Thanks to Adrian Ulrich for his quick report.
	* fix another mis conversion of sector_div() in alloc.[ch].
	* replace PAGE_DEBUG() + BUG() pairs with PAGE_BUG() that prints
	  some more information on the specified page also for no debug
	  version.

nilfs-2.0.1  Mon Mar 24, 2008 JST

	* add nfs support.
	* fix arithmetic range overflow of alloc.h.
	* fix gcc-4.2 warnings on 64-bit machines.
	* make many changes to avoid scripts/checkpatch.pl errors and warnings
	  due to violations of the Linux kernel coding style.  Most of them
	  are lexical adjustments, but include some influential changes such
	  as removal of typedefs.
	* prevent premature writeback of super block.
	* incorporate changes on nilfs_fs.h to prepare for future extensions.
	* adjust mount-time revision check of disk format not to break
	  forward compatibility among NILFS versions with a same major
	  revision.
	* extend the period of copyright notice to include 2008.
	* use kthread_run() instead of kernel_thread().
	* remove unused declarations and needless functions.
	* integrate symlink.c into namei.c.
	* remove expanded rcs keywords.
	* remove comments to overwrite emacs mode.
	* remove C99 style comments.
	* add .gitignore.

nilfs-2.0.0  Mon Feb 18, 2008 JST

	* Removed fastcall specifiers to fix a compile-time error on kernel
	  2.6.25-rc2.
	* Reflected the changes of ioctl() interface on the previous release
	  to ioctl32().  This fixes errors of nilfs-utils arising on 32-bit
	  Linux environments with a 64-bit kernel.
	
nilfs-2.0.0-testing-9  Wed Feb 13, 2008 JST

	* Supported kernel 2.6.25-rc1 experimentally.
	* Fixed compiler errors that occur where CONFIG_LBD is not defined.
	* Fixed an elementary bug that causes a NULL-pointer dereference
	  exception when a snapshot mount was tried with an invalid option.
	* Fixed a hang problem arising under a near disk full condition.
	  This change simplifies error handlings of such condition and the
	  sematics of reserved disk space;  now it works as a margin just for
	  the cleaner.  Additionally, a lower limit was adopted for the number
	  of reserved segments to improve the stability on small partitions.
	* Fixed a few bugs of write routines that cause hang problems.
	  Thanks to Gergely Gábor for his helpful reports and cooperation.

nilfs-2.0.0-testing-8  Thu Dec 27, 2007 JST

	* Fixed a timing problem of a shrinker that causes a critical list
	  corrption of B-tree node pages.
	* Fixed a dead lock problem of the segment constructor that may occur
	  when issuing direct I/O reads.
	* Fixed memory allocation failures on ioctl.c due to fragmentation.
	* Fixed a few minor bugs around the B-tree node buffers.
	* Revised the segment buffer for simplicity and for maintainability.
	* Separated some declarations for the list of full segments from the
	  segment constructor (seglist.h).  This nasty file would be removed
	  in a future release.
	
nilfs-2.0.0-testing-7  Thu Nov 29, 2007 JST

	* Supported kernel 2.6.24-rc3 experimentally.
	* Fixed failures in case where the block size is smaller than
	  the page size.
	* Fixed a compatiblity issue that causes ioctl errors where the
	  kernel and userland programs have different integer length.
	* Fixed a leak bug of btree node buffers at nilfs_btree_mark().
	* Fixed possible failures due to missing exclusion controls of
	  nilfs_bmap_propagate() and nilfs_bmap_assign().
	* Fixed a possible race problem in nilfs_prepare_write().
	* Revised source code around btree node buffers, pages, and shadow
	  DAT in order to get rid of timing bugs and leak bugs.

nilfs-2.0.0-testing-6  Mon Oct 22, 2007 JST

	* Fixed a bug that may cause corruption of meta data files or
	  regular files. This fix would resolve serveral serious problems
	  and improves the stability especially for small memory machines.
	* Fixed a minor bug that led to a failure when deleting checkpoint
	  directly through ioctl.

nilfs-2.0.0-testing-5  Mon Oct 15, 2007 JST

	* Fixed a deadlock problem and block address translation errors
	  caused by a missing initialization of the btree node cache on
	  shadow DAT.

nilfs-2.0.0-testing-4  Thu Oct 11, 2007 JST

	* Supported kernel 2.6.23
	* Fixed a security hole arround nilfs_find_entry()
