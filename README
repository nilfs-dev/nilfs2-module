NILFS - A New Implementation of a Log-structured File System for Linux
========================================================================

What is NILFS?
--------------

NILFS is a new implementation of a log-structured file system for 
Linux 2.6 operating system.  Conventional features of a log-structured
file systems (LFS) are high write performance and fast recovery
time.  In addition, LFS prevents data write operations from overwriting
the disk blocks, thereby minimizing the damage to file data and system
consistency on hardware failure.  Furthermore, LFS writes data and
meta-data in the correct order which helps ensuring consistency in the
entire file system.  LFS can instantaneously create file system
snapshots and check the file system speedy.  We implemented ``NILFS''
using modern technology: For example, the file and inode blocks are
managed by a B-tree structure, internal data are processed in 64 bit
wide word size.  The B-tree structure enables ``NILFS'' to create and
store huge files.  

NILFS will be freely-distributable Open Source software, will be
released under the GNU GPL.

What is NILFS version 2?
------------------------

NILFS version 2 is a new implementation of NILFS for Linux 2.6
operating system.  NILFS version 2 is equipped with the Garbage Collector
that can keep numerous snapshots of NILFS filesystem.  You can
preserve some consistent states (checkpoints) of NILFS filesystem as
snapshots ``after'' the states are established.  For example, when you
have removed some files accidentally, you can get the snapshot that
represent the past state which holds the vanished files.  Checkpoints
are collected by the garbage collector unless they are marked
as ``snapshot''.

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure you have all the following installed:

- Linux 2.6.11~2.6.25
  The kernel should be used on the build machine, and it should be
  compiled from the source.  The source tree which was used to build 
  the kernel is also required.
- GCC
- GNU Make
- GNU Binutils
- Development package of uuid library (e.g., e2fsprogs-devel or
  uuid-dev)
- the proc kernel module
- newer umount utility

This program was tested on some i386-architecture machines (e.g.,
Pentium-3 or Pentium-4 with Hyper Threading Technology), x86_64 and
ppc64 architecture machines. It may cause problems on other
architectures.

Installation
------------

1. Get the source package of NILFS2 and NILFS2 utilities, then extract
   the tar ball files

2. Compile and install NILFS2 

  Kernel module
   # cd fs
   # make
   # make install
   (you should run "make uninstall" if you have already installed)

   The file "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/nilfs/nilfs2.ko" may be
   created.

  Userland tools
   # ./configure
   # make
   # make install

3. Format a disk partition for a new NILFS2 file system, and mount it

   e.g.
   # mkfs -t nilfs2 /dev/sda2
   # mkdir /nilfs
   # mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sda2 /nilfs

4. NILFS2 cleaner configuration

   You can tune the behavior of the garbage collector.
   See /etc/nilfs_cleanerd.conf 

5. How to make a snapshot and mount your snapshot
   Two important terminology, ``checkpoint'' and ``snapshot''.

   A checkpoint represents a consistent state of NILFS filesystem,
   many checkpoints are created automatically and continuously.
   Each checkpoint has a unique checkpoint number.  Checkpoints may
   be collected by the garbage collector.  There is a cleaner parameter
   ``protection_period'', means a checkpoint has never collected within
   the period (in second) from its creation time.  So, if you want to
   recover some files that made yesterday, you specify larger (> 86400) 
   protection_period to /etc/nilfs_cleanerd.conf.

   A snapshot is a checkpoint that is marked as a snapshot.
   Some userland commands perform the marking operation.
   Snapshots are protected from garbage collection, they remains
   forever. Snapshots are mountable as read-only filesystem.

   mkcp     makes a checkpoint immediately.
   mkcp -s  makes a checkpoint immediately and mark it as a snapshot.
   lscp     shows checkpoints.
   chcp     makes existing checkpoints to snapshots and vise versa.

   # mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sda2 /nilfs
   # --- some operation ---
   # lscp
                 CNO        DATE     TIME  MODE  NBLKINC       ICNT

                   3  2007-06-13 11:39:29  cp          9      22017
                   4  2007-06-13 11:39:48  cp       7543      22315
   # chcp ss 2

                   2  2007-06-13 11:39:16  ss     102769      22017

                   4  2007-06-13 11:39:48  cp       7543      22315
   # mount -t nilfs2 -r -o cp=3 /dev/sda2 /nilfs-cp
   # df -t nilfs2

6. Snapshot operations

lscp - list checkpoints
lscp [-rsh] [device]
    -r  list in reverse order
    -s  list snapshots only
    -h  display help message and exit
    ----
    List checkpoints and snapshots of specified NILFS v2 file system.

   # lscp
                 CNO        DATE     TIME  MODE  NBLKINC       ICNT
                   1  2007-06-13 11:38:27  cp         11          3
                   2  2007-06-13 11:39:16  ss     102769      22017
                   3  2007-06-13 11:39:29  cp          9      22017
                   4  2007-06-13 11:39:48  cp       7543      22315
		        checkpoint/snapshot^       ^number of blocks
  checkpoint number^  ^creation time              number of inodes^     

mkcp - make a checkpoint
mkcp [-sh] [device]
    -s  create a snapshot
    -h  display help message and exit
    ----
    Flush in-core buffer data to disk, then make a checkpoint
    that holds current state of the file system.  You can make a snapshot
    with -s option.

chcp - change checkpoint mode
chcp [-h] ss/cp [device] checkpoint_number...
     -h  display help message and exit
     ss  make snapshot
     cp  revert snapshot to checkpoint
    ----
    Change checkpoint mode, checkpoints to snapshots and vise versa.
    Multiple checkpoint numbers are accepted.

rmcp - remove checkpoints
rmcp [-fih] [device] checkpoint_number...
    -f  force 
    -i  interactive
    ----
    Remove checkpoints forever, never be back.

Good luck!
